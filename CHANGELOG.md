# Changelog

All notable changes to dirge are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and the project
adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.3] - 2026-06-02

### Added
- Unified permission/authorization engine (single Policy Decision Point):
  op-based rules, `/why` decision-trace command, atomic multi-claim bash.
- Input box scrolls to keep the cursor visible past the height cap, and
  Up/Down navigate across soft-wrapped display rows.
- Cohesive low-saturation phosphor palette (hue = action, brightness =
  importance), a dedicated soft "thinking" color, and syntax-highlighted
  `read` boxes. Critic/thinking colors are config-themeable.
- Config-driven plugin toggles (`plugins.<name>.{enabled, auto_start}`)
  and a bundled `backpressured` validation-gated loop plugin.

### Changed
- Lighter terminal UI: the heavy double-line frame is now light
  single-line/rounded, the side panels follow the main frame's theme
  color, and the input prompt is a simple `> `.
- Reasoning/thinking is suppressed by default (spinner + Ctrl+O to
  expand) to keep the conversation focused.

### Fixed
- Secrets in tool output are redacted before reaching the LLM / session
  transcript.
- Transient LLM connection failures ("error sending request") now retry
  with exponential backoff.
- Questionnaire custom answers soft-wrap instead of running off-screen.
- Edit results collapse the appended LSP diagnostics into a one-line
  summary (Ctrl+O to expand); diagnostic floods are summarized and the
  per-file cap tightened, so an unsupported language server no longer
  floods the chat.
- A configured `deny` rule is now terminal above a session allowlist.
- Resumed sessions keep persisting after a save (loaded-mtime refresh).

### Packaging
- Published to crates.io as the **`dirge-agent`** crate (the short
  `dirge` name was taken); the installed binary is still `dirge`:
  `cargo install dirge-agent`.

## [1.0.0]

First tagged release. dirge is a minimalistic, memory-efficient coding
agent in Rust with:

- A terminal UI with markdown rendering, scrollback, and an info panel.
- Configurable permission modes (standard / restrictive / accept / yolo)
  with op-based rules and session allowlists.
- Tree-sitter bash permission parsing and semantic code tools for
  TypeScript, Python, Clojure, Go, Ruby, Rust, Java, C, and C++.
- Claude-compatible skills, persistent project memory, subagents, MCP and
  LSP integration, and a Janet plugin system.
- Session save/load/resume with LLM-summarization compaction.
